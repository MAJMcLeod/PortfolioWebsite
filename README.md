# PortfolioWebsite
This website acts as both a developer portfolio piece and as an art portfolio for my 3d artworks and animations. This is a cumulation of all the current coding knowledge I have
and acts as a sort of capstone that helps me and anyone else interested to see what I am capable of and how far I have come and learned over time.

# How to Install and Run

Just download the capstone 15 file and save it wherever desired, all that is needed to run the website is your browser. All resources required to run the website are 
found in the folder. Once downloaded run the artLandingPage document, which will take you to the landing page of the website
